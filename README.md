### Project Description:
This project is a simple REST api for a theoretical blog website made for an assignment at [@SanDiegoCodeSchool](https://github.com/SanDiegoCodeSchool).

The api stores and retrieves data from a mongodb database, but there's no front-end to speak of so this project doesn't serve much purpose on its own.

This project is deployed to [Heroku](https://of-node200-mongoose.herokuapp.com/).

#### Setup:
You can clone this project to your machine with `git clone git@github.com:Z4rkal/node200-mongoose-blog-api.git`.

The project requires a mongodb instance running on your machine.

To launch the project, you'll need to run `npm install` to download the dependencies and then `npm start` to launch the server, which listens on port 3000. You can use an app like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to make requests to the `/api/users/` and `/api/blogs/` endpoints.
